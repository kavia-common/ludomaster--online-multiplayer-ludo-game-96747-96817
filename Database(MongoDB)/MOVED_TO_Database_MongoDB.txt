This directory name uses parentheses which can cause issues in container/build environments (bash/Docker error: syntax error near unexpected token '(').

All database assets were moved to:
../Database_MongoDB/

Action to take:
- Update all Dockerfiles, docker-compose, CI scripts, and shell commands to reference:
  Database_MongoDB/
  instead of:
  Database(MongoDB)/

Key commands:
  node Database_MongoDB/scripts/initSchema.js
  node Database_MongoDB/scripts/initMongoose.js

Backend imports:
  const { getDb } = require('../Database_MongoDB/src/db/connection');

Note:
If you absolutely must reference this path in bash, you would need to escape it:
  Database\(MongoDB\)
or quote it:
  "Database(MongoDB)"
However, the recommended fix is to always use Database_MongoDB/ to avoid shell parsing errors.
